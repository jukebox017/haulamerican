		<h1>Full-Service Demolition and Junk Removal</h1>
		<p class="section-description">
			We handle your heavy lifting. Our professional crew removes unwanted items
			from your residence, commercial property, or estate … including furniture,
			appliances, mattresses and tires (yes … those things others aren’t willing to
			haul!), electronics, hot tubs, yard waste (branches, brush, green waste),
			construction/demolition debris, and more. We offer everything from single-item
			pickups and same-day service to complete garage/estate cleanouts,
			foreclosure/eviction cleanouts, and renovation trash hauling. As a locally and
			family owned company, we pride ourselves on transparent upfront pricing, with no-
			obligation, no-pressure quotes via text (or website pricing tool, coming soon),
			licensed & insured operations, courteous uniformed crews, and no hidden fees.
			We leave everything tidy, and work around your lifestyle, including tight
			driveways, dirt roads, and tricky mountain access.

		<h1>Small-Load Hay Delivery & Stacking</h1>
		<p class="section-description">
			Whether you're a backyard horse owner, hobby farm enthusiast, or your
			managing an entire ranch, we make it easy to get quality hay delivered directly to
			you. We neatly stack small to medium loads of premium hay in your barn, stable,
			or storage area. We pride ourselves on absolutely no delivery minimums, which is
			perfect for the 1–99+ bale jobs that larger feed outlets won’t service. Our team
			handles unloading and stacking to save your back and time … ideal for rural
			properties, tight access spots, or anyone without a truck and trailer. Or you may
			normally haul your own hay, but life has got busy and you just need help in a
			pinch! We offer flexible scheduling, including weekends and emergency options
			when available.
